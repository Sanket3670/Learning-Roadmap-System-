# Learning-Roadmap-System
Students often struggle to manage their academic tasks effectively due to a lack of structured planning tools and personalized academic support. Traditional systems or manual methods used for organizing study schedules are inefficient, leading to missed deadlines, poor time management, and reduced academic performance. There is a pressing need for a digital solution that allows students to seamlessly plan, organize, and track their study activities while adapting to their unique academic needs and learning pace. 
To address these gaps, the Learning Roadmap System project aims to build a secure, responsive, and data-driven application that supports students in planning their academic journey efficiently.
